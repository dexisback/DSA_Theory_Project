### Subway Rail Management System

### Summary:
- The Subway Management System is a C-based simulation that models an urban metro network. Each subway station is represented as a node in a graph, and tracks connecting them are edges. The system uses Dijkstra’s algorithm, enhanced with a priority queue, to calculate the shortest route between stations based on distance and waiting times at signals. The project demonstrates efficient pathfinding and network optimization and supports map visualization for route display.
